Patch status: limbo, but should be fixed when GLX code is removed again

chromium has removed some GLX code which Qt has temporarily(?)
restored in [1]. This however seems to misses some headers and
only works with some configurations and fails with others[2].
So add the headers here as a quick fix for now.
