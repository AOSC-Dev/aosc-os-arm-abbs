# Note: --disable-utf8proc
#
# According to tmux's "Installing" documentation:
#
# macOS's builtin UTF-8 support is very poor, so it is best to use the
# utf8proc library if possible. Once it is installed, pass
# --enable-utf8proc to configure.
#
# However, this part of code was not updated in the last 9 years.
#
# Disable it for now as it would appear that we don't need it anyway.
