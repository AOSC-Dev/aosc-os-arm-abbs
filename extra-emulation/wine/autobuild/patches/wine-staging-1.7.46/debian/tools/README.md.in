What is Wine Staging?
---------------------

**Warning: Do not report bugs at bugs.winehq.org when using this version!
Please take a look [here](http://bugs.wine-staging.com) for more information
about how to report bugs.**

**Wine Staging** (formerly wine-compholio) is a special wine version containing
bug fixes and features, which are not yet available in regular wine versions.
The idea of Wine Staging is to provide new features faster to end users and to
give developers the possibility to discuss and improve their patches before
they are sent upstream. We also intend to create a community of wine developers
to share experience and to make it easier for beginners to start hacking on
wine. More information about Wine Staging can also be found on our website
[wine-staging.com](http://wine-staging.com).

Although we are reviewing and testing all patches before adding them, you may
encounter additional bugs, which are not present in vanilla wine. Make sure to
report such issues in our bug tracker instead of winehq.org so that we can try
to solve them in future versions. Thanks!

How to install and use Wine Staging
-----------------------------------

Ready-to-use packages for Wine Staging are available for a variety
of different Linux distributions directly for download. Just follow the
instructions available on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/Installation).

When using Wine Staging there are a few differences compared to regular
Wine. The main difference is that it is not sufficient to type `wine` to
run it, but instead you will have to type `/opt/wine-staging/bin/wine`.
Besides that there are also some other differences, for example additional
configuration options to tweak performance, which are not available in regular
Wine. All those differences are also documented on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/Usage).
