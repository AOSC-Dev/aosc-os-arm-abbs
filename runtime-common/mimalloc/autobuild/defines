# Default behavior (-DMI_INSTALL_TOPLEVEL=OFF) puts libraries inside a 
# sub-directory in /usr/lib, which will cause unnecessary rebuilds on update.
# Use -DMI_INSTALL_TOPLEVEL=ON to install libraries in /usr/lib.
# Building static libraries will put the static libraries in the generated
# cmake files, which will break when we strip them off. Use -DMI_BUILD_STATIC=OFF
# to turn it off.
# Building object file will put the object file in /usr/lib which
# is unnecessary. Use -DMI_BUILD_OBJECT=OFF to turn it off.
