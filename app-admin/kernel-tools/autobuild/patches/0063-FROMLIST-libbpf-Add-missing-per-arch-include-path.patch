Subject: [PATCH 063/119] FROMLIST: libbpf: Add missing per-arch include path
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

libbpf does not include the per-arch tools include path, e.g.
tools/arch/riscv/include. Some architectures depend those files to
build properly.

Include tools/arch/$(SUBARCH)/include in the libbpf build.

Fixes: 6d74d178fe6e ("tools: Add riscv barrier implementation")
