Subject: [PATCH 182/300] AOSCOS: platform: ideapad-laptop: fix if branch
 syntax

With "AOSCOS: platform: x86: ideapad-laptop: add fixes for ThinkBook 14+
(2024 G6+)", an if branch guarding a no-data condition was introduced:

  if(!data)
  	acpi_handle_info(handle, "no data");
  	return;

However, it was missing braces as it's a multi-line branch.

Add a pair of braces to fix this syntax error.
