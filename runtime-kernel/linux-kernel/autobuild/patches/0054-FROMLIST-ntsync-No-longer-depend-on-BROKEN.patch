Subject: [PATCH 054/102] FROMLIST: ntsync: No longer depend on BROKEN.

f5b335dc025cfee90957efa90dc72fada0d5abb4 ("misc: ntsync: mark driver as "broken"
to prevent from building") was committed to avoid the driver being used while
only part of its functionality was released. Since the rest of the functionality
has now been committed, revert this.
