Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: interrupt-controller: loongson,liointc: Fix
 dtbs_check warning for reg-names

As we know, the Loongson-2K0500 is a single-core CPU, and the core1-
related register (isr1) does not exist. So "reg" and "reg-names" should
be set to "minItems 2"(main nad isr0).

This fixes dtbs_check warning:
