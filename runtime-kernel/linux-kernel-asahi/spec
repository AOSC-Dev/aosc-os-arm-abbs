# Due to the sheer number of commits from Asahi Linux (AsahiLinux/linux), it's
# no longer possible to maintain a patch set in autobuild/patches. Maintainers
# should use the following procedure to bump version:
#
# - In AOSC-Dev/linux, branch off `aosc-main-x.y.z' into `aosc-asahi-x.y.z',
#   in accordance with the Asahi versioning.
# - Merge latest `asahi-x.y-N' from AsahiLinux/linux into `aosc-asahi-x.y.z'.
# - Find and revert the commit `271457a92d72e9326232a5756231b801e156e528'.
#   This commits causes `asahi' to be injected to local name during build and
#   doesn't work well with AOSC build scripts, as our script relies on correct
#   local name from kernel config.
# - Cherry-pick the commit `24e265a536c13f8212db7aa65e147cfc5aaa136d' to bump
#   Rust and bindgen versions.
# - Push your changes to AOSC-Dev/linux.
