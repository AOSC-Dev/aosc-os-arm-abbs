# Due to the sheer number of commits from Asahi Linux (AsahiLinux/linux), it's
# no longer possible to maintain a patch set in autobuild/patches. Maintainers
# should use the following procedure to bump version:
#
# - In AOSC-Tracking/linux, branch off `aosc/vx.y.z' into `aosc/vx.y.z-asahi',
#   in accordance with the Asahi versioning.
#   Note that the branching-off point might need to be earlier than branch tip
#   to exclude some loongarch64 specific patches. These patches (currently)
#   might not build correctly on other architectures.
# - Merge latest `asahi-x.y-N' from AsahiLinux/linux into `aosc/vx.y.z-asahi'.
# - Find and revert the commit `271457a92d72e9326232a5756231b801e156e528'.
#   This commits causes `asahi' to be injected to local name during build and
#   doesn't work well with AOSC build scripts, as our script relies on correct
#   local name from kernel config.
# - Push your changes to AOSC-Tracking/linux, tagging the latest patchset with
#   REL (use -0 for the initial release).
