# FIXME:
#
# Touch a transitional file to prevent accidental removal by dpkg, as it
# would otherwise consider the package fully replaced (does not provide any
# file), causing lua to be removed as a dependency whilst its reverse
# dependencies continued to be configured - resulting in dpkg errors.
#  
# Is this a dpkg bug? Not sure.
