# Upstream suddenly decided not to use semantic versioning.
# Remember to change PKGEPOCH if upstream change the versioning scheme again.
# It was 0.x.y and 1.x.y, then 2, and now it is 3.

# FIXME: It looks like versions with single major number may bug APT out:
# E: Problem parsing dependency 20 of iptsd-dbg:amd64=3
# E: Error occurred while processing iptsd-dbg (NewVersion2)
# E: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/_debs_Packages
# E: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.
