Subject: [PATCH 08/41] LoongArch: Fix inconsistency in SHMLBA macro values
 between glibc and kernel

The LoongArch glibc was using the value of the SHMLBA macro from common code,
which is __getpagesize() (16k), but this was inconsistent with the value of
the SHMLBA macro in the kernel, which is SZ_64K (64k). This caused several
shmat-related tests in LTP (Linux Test Project) to fail. This commit fixes
the issue by ensuring that the glibc's SHMLBA macro value matches the value
used in the kernel like other architectures.
